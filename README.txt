Some of the 3d modeler I was working on last year. C++/Qt w/ old school OpenGL. This was mostly an exercise in collision 
detection with verts/lines/faces/objects. 

Ctrl-Left mouse rotates scene
Ctrl-Right mouse drags scene
Ctrl-Mousewheel zooms in and out

Shift-R will select an edge ring
Shift-L will select an edge loop

Spacebar deselects all

I would like to convert this to WebGL + CoffeeScript (hence the Flux3d project that I'll never start).

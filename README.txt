Some of the 3d modeler I was working on in 2010. C++/Qt w/ old school OpenGL. This was mostly an exercise in collision 
detection and triangulation with verts/lines/faces/objects. 

Ctrl-Left mouse rotates scene
Ctrl-Right mouse drags scene
Ctrl-Mousewheel zooms in and out

Shift-R will select an edge ring
Shift-L will select an edge loop

Spacebar deselects all

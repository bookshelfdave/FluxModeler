Some of the 3d modeler I was working on last year. C++ w/ old school OpenGL.


Ctrl-Left mouse rotates scene
Ctrl-Right mouse drags scene
Ctrl-Mousewheel zooms in and out

Shift-R will select an edge ring
Shift-L will select an edge loop

Spacebar deselects all

I would like to convert this to WebGL + CoffeeScript (or maybe even Racket).
